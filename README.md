Hello,

Prashant here,

Here is the prompt for your preferences:

Build a secure and efficient smart contract in Solidity (latest version) for a wallet extension named "DeWallet". The contract should include all essential features for wallet creation, funds sending/receiving, and wallet recovery. Ensure the contract is optimized for gas efficiency and works seamlessly on the Sepolia testnet. Use Web3.js or Ethers.js for blockchain interaction, and implement AES encryption or similar for securing sensitive data like seed phrases and private keys. The contract should allow users to generate a new wallet with a 12-word seed phrase (BIP-39 standard), securely store the encrypted seed phrase, and enable wallet recovery using the seed phrase. Implement functions for sending and receiving ETH, including gas fee estimation and secure transaction signing. Add support for ERC-20 tokens and include event logging for all major actions like wallet creation and funds transfer. Ensure the contract is thoroughly tested and optimized for deployment on Sepolia. Provide the Solidity code, deployment scripts, and a brief document explaining the workflow. Use the latest Solidity features like require, assert, and events for better code readability and security. Make sure the system is scalable and can handle multiple users efficiently.  Just build smart contract only. Include all features if I forget to mention something for creating wallet extension.
